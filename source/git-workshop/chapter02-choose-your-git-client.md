# <a id="top">Choose your git client</a>

For the workshop the command line will be used so you can focus on understanding the commands that are used.

You can follow along with either a command line or graphical git tool.  Please note that installing a graphical tool for git should also provide git on the command line, so no need to install both!

## Command Line tools

You can simply install the git command line tools from [www.git-scm.com](http://www.gitscm.com).

If you have Ubuntu, then you can use the Ubuntu software center or install git on the command line

    apt-get install git


## GUI tools

The simplest graphical tools to install are from Github.  If you browse any repository on [www.github.com](https://www.github.com) you will notice a "Clone in Mac" or "Clone in Windows" button at the top left of the page.  If you have not Git tool installed, then you are redirected to a page offering to install the Github graphical git client for you.
