# <a id="top">Heroku Workshop - Java & Play framework</a>

This workshop will give you experience deploying and managing an application on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a cloud application platform.  Before you start the workshop there will be a [presentation on Heroku](http://www.slideshare.net/JR0cket/introduction-to-heroku-cct-london-2013), describing the service and giving you a basic idea of how to deploy scalable applications.

  A great way to understand the value of Heroku is to use it in your projects.  In this workshop we try and simulate the project experience as much as we can, although there are limits.  The workshop you will guide you through all the steps to build a relatively simple Java application using the Play framework.
