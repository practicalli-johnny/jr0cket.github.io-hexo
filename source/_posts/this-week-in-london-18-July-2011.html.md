Agile testing - a developers perspective.  A  talk about agile testing at Atlassian (creators of JIRA, etc) from one  of the graduate developers over from Sydney Australia.  Its a chance to  ask questions about how agile testing affects what you do as a  developer.

[Developer sessions](http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/16692823/)  - London Java / Graduate developer and lots of other communities get  together an share experiences and war stories over a pint or three.

On Wednesday, learn how to write good (idiomatic) Scala with the London Scala user group.   Kevin Wright has a huge amount of knowledge about development with the  Scala language and if you wanted to learn how to write some good stuff  in the language then this event is for you.

On Thursday you can practice what you learnt at the Scala coding dojo at YouDevise.  Take all the advice and discussion from Wednesday and apply them in code.  At the dojo we spilt up into teams of 3-5 people, so  everyone gets involved and is able to learn something.  No previous  Scala experience is required, enthusiasm (and Google) are all that is needed.  [LSug sign up](http://lsug.net/)
