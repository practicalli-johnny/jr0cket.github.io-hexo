Scrum is a framework for agile product development.  Products are built iteratively, with each Sprint creating an increment of the product, usually starting with the most valuable and riskiest.

More and more Sprints create additional increments of  the product. Each increment is a potentially shippable slice of the  entire product. When enough increments have been created for the  Product to be of value, the product is released.

The official scrum guide states that Scrum is:

*   a framework for optimising your own process
*   grounded in process control theory
*   iterative and incremental approach
*   optimisation of predictability
*   control of risksOther aspects of scrum theory include:

**Transparency** - visible to those managing the outcomes - complete work matches definition of done

**Inspection** - frequently enough to detect unacceptable variances (Note: Shrodingers cat)

**Adaptation** - correct process issues quickly
-- Daily scrum meeting - sprint goal adaptation - optomise for next working day
-- Sprint review (showcase) and Sprint planning - release goal adaptation - optomise the next sprint
-- Sprint Retrospective - review the past sprint - adapt for next sprint

# Scrum team characteristics

*   Self organising
*   Cross functional
*   Iterative working
*   Time boxed activities

# Scrum roles

**Scrum Master** ensures that the scrum process (values, practices  &amp; rules) are understood and followed by the team. Encouraging  self-organisation and removing impediments for the team.  The scrum  master advises the team on how the scrum framework can be utilized  most effectively.

**Product Owner** is focused on maximising value that the team  delivers - manages priorities and solely responsible for the product  backlog priorities.

**Team** is the collection of people who have all the necessary  skills to get the work each sprint and are preferably cross functional  (everyone does everything).  Typical team size is 5-9 people, not  counting product owner &amp; scrum master

The following activities in Scrum are time-boxed in help keep focus and remain effective.

**Release planning meeting** is to establish an overall plan and set  of goals for the project that the organisation can understand as see  value in.  Establishes the overall features (MMF's) and major risks of  the project, indicating probable release date and costs.  The release  plan is reviewed (and modified if necessary) on a per sprint basis.

**Sprint** is the name for an iteration in the project.  During  the sprint the scrum master blocks changes that would affect the sprint  goal.  The team members are fixed for the duration of the sprint, as is  the goal of that sprint.  A sprint consists of a sprint planning  meeting, the work, the sprint review and sprint retrospective.  Sprints  occur one after another with no time in between and typically a sprint  duration is between 1 to 4 weeks long.

**Sprint planning meeting** is a just in time planning session for  each sprint.  Typically 2 hours per week of the sprint duration (2 week  sprint = ~4 hours sprint planning).  The meeting is split into two  parts: define the goal of the sprint (the "what"); create the sprint  backlog (the "how").

**Sprint review** is held at the end of each sprint (2 week sprint =  ~2 hours sprint review).  Scrum team discusses with stakeholders the  work done in the sprint and what work could be done next.  The product  owner will give an update on the status of the project (product backlog,  velocity, release date).  It is important to show the working software  (i.e. a showcase) to get valuable feedback.  The sprint review provides  valuable input into the next sprint planning meeting.

**Sprint retrospective** occurs after the sprint review and before  the next planning meeting (2 week sprint = ~1.5 hours).  The scrum  master guides the team to improve the process for the next sprint,  reviewing how the last sprint went (people, relationships, process and  tools) and what actionable improvements could be made.

**Daily scrum** occurs daily at the same time (~15 minutes) to  inspect the progress towards the scrum goal and improve the teams'  chance of meeting that goal. Each team member states: what they  accomplished; what they are working on next; what obstacles are in there  way.  The scrum aims to improve communication by reducing other  meetings, identifying impediments, promote quick decision making  (without limiting options) and improve product knowledge.

# Sprint Artifacts

**Product backlog** is a dynamic list of requirements (user stories)  that could be done in for the project, managed and prioritised by the  product owner to deliver the most value.  In larger projects,  functionality is often grouped into feature sets.  The product backlog  lasts for the useful life of the product and dynamically changes  according to business or commercial needs.

**Release burn-down** records the remaining estimated effort of  the product backlog across the timeline of the release plan, usually  using a sprint length as the measure of time.  Initial estimates created  from the release planning meeting give a high level view of the work,  so you can project the work remaining based on the teams capacity for  doing the work (velocity).  Note: Burn-up charts have benefits when the  feature set of a project continually grows.

**Sprint backlog** is the set of tasks to be worked on for a  particular sprint, identified by the team mainly during the sprint  planning meeting, but also during the sprint.  Only the team can change  the sprint backlog during the sprint, but should do so only with respect  to the sprint goal.

**Sprint burn-down** records the remaining sprint backlog across the sprint by summing the backlog estimates every day of the sprint.

# The meaning of Done

Scrum requires that a team build an increment of product functionality  during each sprint that is potentially shippable.  Therefore the increment should be a slice through the product (from user interface to back end services).  Each increment should be additive to all prior  increments and throughly tested, ensuring that all increments work  together.

Everyone involved must have a shared understanding of what done means, therefore the term done must be defined by all involved.

# Scrum rules

- Only the team can talk during a daily scrum
- The purpose of each sprint is to deliver increments of potentially  shippable functionality that adheres to a working definition of "done".

# Tips

Scrum master works with customers and management to establish a product  owner - SM teaches PO the role - PO manages team to optimise value

The scrum master can be any member of the team - product owner though would have conflict of interest, so avoid

The scrum master is a role and should be shared between the team where  possible to help maintain team cohesiveness and maintain a balanced  approach.

Acceptance tests are often used as another product backlog item  attribute.  Often supplanting more detailed text descriptions of what  done is.

Undone work is often accumulated in a product backlog item called undone  work or implementation work.  As this work accumulates, the product  backlog burndown remains more accurate than if it weren't accumulated.

# Not part of Scrum

The following aspects of managing a project are not explicitly covered  in the scrum framework, although there are lots of complementary techniques that a team can use whist striving to become agile

*   Estimation techniques
*   Prioritisation techniques
*   Visualisation of work activites (eg. Kanban)
*   Managing work in progress
*   Continual Improvement - Kaizen

# In Summary

My own view is that scrum is a great way to start making your  organisation a little more agile, especially if your organisation is  well ordered and used to a structured process.  It is a very light  process framework that can be effectively used to build the core of your  own agile process.   In essence it is an example of a [plan,do,check,act cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) to help manage change, adding specific activities, rules and roles to give a base structure for an agile way of working.

It is important to get a solid grasp of what you are trying to achieve  with scrum (manage change effectively) and understand the reasons behind  the rules, roles and activities in scrum.  The specific practices are flexible enough to adapt to the circumstances of each organisation  without loosing the values and overall goals of scrum.

Approaches such as Behaviour Driven Development, Kanban and XP are also  effective at managing change, having subtle differences in focus and defining variations and additions to the practices of scrum whilst sharing (in some cases extending) the agile principles that underpin  scrum.

If any change is difficult to introduce when trying to improve a teams  effectiveness, then I recommend using Kanban to visualise the current  practices / process so that when discussions take place about change the  facts about the current situation are inescapable.

Thank you.
