Regardless of the processes and tools you put in place to become more agile, you should take the time to appreciate the principles of agile to help you understand what you are aiming for.  Reading and understanding the implications of the agile manifesto is therefore a valuable start, although it is just a start of a very important change.

Here is a quick summary of the agile manifesto to get you started:
