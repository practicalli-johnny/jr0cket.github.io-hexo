Karl Scotland and I will be running [a free games night at Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-scrum/the-ball-flow-game) on the evening of 7th March at SkilsMatter - London, UK.

Karl has kindly volunteered to run the games night before [his talk at QCon](http://qconlondon.com/london-2011/presentation/Kanban+System+Design) later in the week.  Karl will be running the ball flow game to help us learn and experience kanban and system thinking concepts in a collaborative way.  It will also be a lot of fun, as fun is an effective way to learn.

You should get a lot out of this evening whether your experienced practitioner or you are completely new to kanban, lean, system thinking and theory of constraints.  The evening will be a welcoming and safe environment to everyone.

Rough plan for the evening:

* 6.00 pm An opportunity to networking, chat to people
* 6.30 pm Start to the evening proper: Introduction and games
* 8.00 pm Retire to the Hat and Feathers for further discussions (optional)
